realm	probability_not_desert	This is the initial probability of an ecoregion within the realm not being within a biome of “Deserts & Xeric Shrublands”.	The map used is based on current biomes. However, the simulation starts with some of the desert biomes possibly being any kind of grassland, “Temperate Broadleaf & Mixed Forests” or “Temperate Conifer Forests”. As the simulation progresses, these can switch to present-day desert.	0	1	none
realm	initial_pop_density_of_desert	This is the initial population density per square mile in deserts within the realm.	These densities are later converted to actual numbers of people.	0	3	
realm	initial_pop_density_of_tundra	This is the initial population density per square mile in tundra within the realm.	These densities are later converted to actual numbers of people.	0	3	
biome/realm combo	initial_pop_density_ratio	This is the ratio of the initial population density per square mile in a biome within the realm to the mean of initial_pop_density_of_desert and initial_pop_density_of_tundra.	This is used to set the initial_pop_density for each biome/realm combination (with the exception of combinations containing desert or tundra).	1	1000	
biome/realm combo	initial_transition_probability_to_desert	This is the initial probability of an ecoregion within the biome/realm combo transitioning to being within a desert biome in year 1.	This factor only has an effect on biomes containing the word “grassland”, plus the biomes of “Temperate Broadleaf & Mixed Forests” and “Temperate Conifer Forests”.	0	0.01	
ecoregion	initial_unaided_not_dt_max_pop_density	This is the maximum initial population density per square mile in the ecoregion, excluding ecoregions within desert or tundra.	It is unaided in the sense that this is what it would be for a hunter-gatherer society without advanced technology.	0.5	10	Must be at least 1.5 times max(initial_unaided_d_max_pop_density, initial_unaided_t_max_pop_density)
ecoregion	initial_unaided_d_max_pop_density	This is the maximum initial population density per square mile in the ecoregion (only considering ecoregions within desert).	It is unaided in the sense that this is what it would be for a hunter-gatherer society without advanced technology.	0.01	2	
ecoregion	initial_unaided_t_max_pop_density	This is the maximum initial population density per square mile in the ecoregion (only considering ecoregions within tundra).	It is unaided in the sense that this is what it would be for a hunter-gatherer society without advanced technology.	0.01	2	
ecoregion	initial_transportation_tech_level_in_use		The transportation_tech_level_in_use (like all of the other tech_level_in_use factors) will always be between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate more sophisticated technology.	0	0.5	
ecoregion	relevance_of_dist_based_on_transportation_tech_level		This is used in a weighting scheme of the graph whose edge weights are distances between locations.	-10000	10000	Cannot be 0
ecoregion	initial_healthcare_tech_level_in_use			0	0.1	
ecoregion	initial_warfare_tech_level_in_use			0	0.1

ecoregion	initial_housing_tech_level_in_use			0	0.7
